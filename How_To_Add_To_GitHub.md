# How to Set Up Your GitHub Profile

## 1. Add the README to Your Profile

To make the `README.md` appear on your GitHub profile page:

1.  **Create a New Repository**:
    *   Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
    *   **Repository Name**: Must match your GitHub username exactly (e.g., if your username is `arghyacr7`, the repo name must be `arghyacr7`).
    *   **Visibility**: Make it **Public**.
    *   **Initialize**: Check the box "Add a README file".

2.  **Update the Content**:
    *   Copy the content of the `README.md` file specifically created for you in this folder.
    *   Edit the new repository's `README.md` (click the Pencil icon) and paste the code.
    *   Commit the changes.
    *   *Note: I assumed your username is `arghyacr7` based on previous links. If different, please update the profile links in the README.*

## 2. "Popular Repositories" Section (Pinned Repos)

The user request mentioned "Popular repositories". On GitHub, this is a specific section called **Pinned**. You cannot "code" this into the README; you must configure it in the GitHub UI.

1.  Go to your GitHub profile page (e.g., `github.com/your-username`).
2.  Scroll down to the "Popular repositories" or "Pinned" section.
3.  Click the **Customize your pins** text (or the small pencil icon/settings gear on the right side of that section).
4.  A modal will pop up listing your repositories.
5.  Search for and select the boxes for:
    *   `urban-style-chatbot`
    *   `Fruit-Classifier`
    *   `arghya-binance-bot`
    *   `DevOps`
    *   `ai-agents-from-scratch`
    *   `suger_and_soul` (or `sugar_and_soul`)
6.  You can drag and drop them to reorder.
7.  Click **Save pins**.

These repositories will now appear at the very top of your profile, just below your README!
